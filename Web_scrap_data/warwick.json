Seminar talk here.\nWorkshop: 'Evidence-based decision support for food security'\nThis workshop brought together food domain experts and modelling experts in an exciting cross-disciplinary meeting to inform and extend current food security research. This workshop brought together two groups of people. The first included domain experts whose primary research activities lie in food research from production, supply to need and nutrition and practitioners who are responsible for policy enactment associated with a nation's food security. The second group of researchers are experts in the elicitation of domain judgments associated with large complex systems of which food production, supply and delivery is an example together with experts in the development of the efficient and effective decision support for such systems. The workshop forms part of a long term aim to build large scale decision support tools to support crisis management and policy design and their implementation associated with addressing food deprivation and alleviating food poverty in the light of various crises and political imperatives.\nA number of promising new collaborations have developed as a result of the workshop.\nDetails of speakers and slides from their talks are available here: Workshop speakers and talks\nMartine was on the scientific committee for the ESGI130 study group with industry.\nMartine was on the Scientific Committee for the European COST workshop on Food Safety and Food Security in Dubrovnik, April 2016.

The modeling often involves very interesting non-linearities and stochastic processes that give rise to novel statistical methodologies. I am in particular interested in the modelling of oscillatory phenomena in biology (epidemics, gene expression, molecular clocks, etc) combined with the analysis of temporal and/or spatio-temporal data (from single cells to meta-populations) and have worked on applications in epidemiology (dynamics of infectious diseases), analytical population dynamics in ecology, transcriptional dynamics of genes and large actigraphic data sets obtained from wearable devices.\nMy collaborations also include addressing statistical and mathematical questions in chronobiology and circadian rhythm with collaborators in the biological sciences and medicine. In a project funded by the Medical Research Council (MRC) I am collaborating with members of the Chronotherapy group at Warwick and INSERM France, to develop statistical methods and models for large data sets of biomarkers on circadian oscillations, including actigraphic data from wearable devices, with the aim of using these for personalized medicine and treatment of cancer patients in their home, and basic research in chronobiology.\n\nCurrent and most recent PhD students:\nSilvia Calderazzo, Simone Tiberi, Panayiota Touloupou (with S Spencer), Elena Camacho-Aguilar (with D Rand), Mans Unosson (with A Johanson), Beniamino Hadj-Amar, Sida Chen, Yiyuan Zhang (with J Brettschneider).\nCurrent and most recent Postdoctoral Collaborators: \nQi Huang, Hiroshi Momiji, Giorgos Minas\nCollaboration with groups in Mathematics, Life Sciences and Medicine led by: \nDavid Rand, Francis L\u00e9vi, Michael White, Julian Davis, Mike Hastings\nWarwick network: E-health applications for physical activity, sleep, and circadian rhythms\n\nRecent publications and preprints (since 2015)\nBeniamino Hadj-Amar, B\u00e4rbel Finkenst\u00e4dt, Mark Fiecas, Robert Huckstepp, A spectral hidden Markov model for non stationary oscillatory processes, arXiv:2001.01676\nCavallaro, M, Walsh, M, Jones, M,Teahan, J, Tiberi, S, Finkenst\u00e4dt, B and Hebenstreit, D, 3\u2019-5\u2019 crosstalk contributes to transcriptional bursting bioRxiv.\nL\u00e9vi, F, Komarzynski, S, Huang, Q, Young, T, Ang, Y, Fuller, C, Bolborea, M, Brettschneider, J, Finkenst\u00e4dt, B, Fursse, J, White, DP, and PF Innominato, Tele-monitoring of cancer patients' rhythms during daily life identifies actionable determinants of circadian and sleep disruption, \u00a0Cancers 2020, 12(7). \nTouloupou, P, Finkenst\u007f\u00e3dt, B, Besser, TE, French, NP, and Spencer, SEF, Bayesian inference for multi-strain epidemics with application to Escherichia Coli O157:H7 in feedlot cattle, to appear in Annals of Applied Statistics, 2020.\n\n\n\nTouloupou, P, Finkenst\u00e4dt, B and Spencer SEF (2019), Scalable Bayesian inference for coupled hidden Markov and semi-Markov models, Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, 2019. \n\nKomarzynski, S, Bolborea, M, Huang, Q, Finkenst\u00e4dt, B, L\u00e9vi, F (2019), Predictability of individual circadian phase during daily routine for medical applications of circadian clocks , Journal of Clinical Investigation (JCI) - Insight, 2019. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHadj-Amar, B., Finkenst\u00e4dt, B., Fiecas, M., L\u00e9vi, F. & Huckstepp, R.

Her methodological research largely focuses on developing models to answer questions raised by health care colleagues, and patients. For example, collaborations with epilepsy specialists in meta-analyses led to papers on biases due to within study selection of outcomes and sub-groups, and to joint models for pre-randomisation seizure counts and post-randomised trials. Collaboration on a trial of ankle sprains has led to models for recovery rates with skew, bounded scores, with missing data.\nProfessor Hutton's research has had impact through clinical guidelines and in legal cases. Work in epilepsy is cited in National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE), SIGN and WHO guidance. Medico-legal cases have addressed life expectancy of people with cerebral palsy, spinal cord injury and traumatic brain injury, and adverse effects of drugs. Expert witness reports have been provided for cases in Australia, Canada, Eire, Hong Kong, South Africa and the four countries of the United Kingdom. The total impact is at least \u00a3100 million.\nProfessor Hutton has written extensively on ethics and philosophy of statistics, in response to challenges arising from medical research and discussions with international statistical colleagues and philosophers. She has contributed to Research Council ethics guidelines. She co-funded Ethics in Mathematics 2, the second Cambridge meeting on Ethics in Mathematics.\nMain collaborations\nProfessor Hutton has major collaborations in cerebral palsy and epilepsy. Her work with Professor Peter Pharoah and Dr Allan Colver, on life expectancy in cerebral palsy, has had a substantial effect on the size of awards in medico-legal cases. This work is widely cited nationally and internationally. In epilepsy, she has contributed to many Cochrane reviews of anti-epileptic drugs. She has worked with Professor Tony Marson, of Liverpool University Neurosciences Department, on various projects. Professor Marson and Hutton collaborated with Professor Jim Smith to explore the role of Chain Event Graphs in modeling and managing chronic diseases.\nDr Freedom Gumedze, of Department of Statistical Sciences, University of Cape Town, holds a Newton Advanced Fellowship awarded by the Academy of Medical Sciences, on which Professor Hutton is the UK co-applicant. Three statistics workshops have been held at the University of Cape Town. Dr Gumedze and Isaac Singini, one of Dr Gumedze's PhD students, have had research visits to Warwick Statistics.\nExternal Roles\nProfessor Hutton is Chair of the Statistics and the Law section of the Royal Statistical Society. She assists with the Royal Statistical Society partnership between AIMS and RSS.\nShe was an UCU appointed non-executive director, University's Superannuation Scheme, 2015-2019\nShe is on the Royal Society panels for Newton Fellowships and Dorothy Hodgkin awards. She was a member of the Core Methodology Panel, National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), 2011-2015, and the Education Committee of the International Biometric Society, 2013-2014. She was a member of the NIHR TCC Fellowship Panel, 2011-2013; the selection committee for the Health Research Board in Ireland, 2012. She has taught at AIMS South Africa, AIMS Ghana, AIMS Tanzania and AIMS Cameroon.

This field studies how geometric considerations restrict and influence the behaviour of physical systems. In more mathematical terms, I consider how algebraic structures, like groups and more general groupoids, can be used to study differential equations. These techniques have applications in many different physical sciences; for example, it helps us understand different animal gaits (basically, how animals move around) in biology.\n\nI am a Senior Fellow of the Higher Education Academy (SFHEA), a Fellow of the Institute for Mathematics and its Applications (FIMA), a Chartered Mathematician (CMath).", "I joined the Department of Statistics in September 2018.

My book in 2010 gives my particular take on Bayesian Decision Analysis. I am currently jointly leading a team of researchers to investigate ways groups of experts in very different domains of knowledge can nevertheless ensure the coherence of their judgments.\nOne increasingly important domain of these technologies is for managing food crises. Colleagues Martine Barons , Manuelle Leonelli and I now have several publications reporting this work and held several decision conferences to inform this challenging inferential problem. We curently run a number of workshops to disseminate this research. I am one of four members of the Food Global Reseach Priority team that has been set up by the university to co-ordinate and resource research into food security. I am part of a team recently funded by the European Food Standands Agency to elicit expert judgments on food.\nI have spent many years studying the theory of graphical models including Bayes Nets, especially focusing on developing dynamic and causal variants of these. Over the last few years I have discovered a new graphical tool - more expressive than the discrete Bayes Net - called a Chain Event Graph appearing this year. Various dynamic and decision theoretic extensions of this now also appear with Ann Nicholson, Peter Thwaites, Bob Cowell, Christiane Gorgen, Rodrigo Collazo, Aditi Shenvi and Rachel Wilkerson: see below.\nI have recently developed new Bayesian selection methods across various classes of models. Over the last few years I have written on how these methods can be applied to biological regulation models, for example for longitudinal circadian gene expression, dynamic graphical models of fMRI images of the brain, longitudinal studies of public health and also crime. Working with several PhD students I have a particular current interest in developing causal discovery algorithms over novel classes of dynamic models, some of which are given above.\nThe links between algebraic geometry and various graphical models have also fascinated me for a long while especially their associated semi-algebraic structures and I have recently made some new contributions to this area. I am now investigating the geometry of probability tree models: see my recent pulications.\nI have had a long interest in Bayesian decision making under conflict and have recently developed multiattribute utility models for helping the design of military training real time decision makers in such environments. I continue to study Bayesian models of forensic evidence and have a special current interest in assesing strength of activity level evidence. Through Warwick University I have been Fellow of the Alan Turing Institute in London from September 2017 where I spend much of my time. I am working on a number of projects there for example leading two on the statistical analyses for decision support for pursuing violent criminals, part of a team investigating how to monitor data for policing Modern Day Slavery and another project designed for resource management and planning for prisons for the Ministry of Justice. \nI act as a consultant for the university for a number of well-known companies. In particular I have a long standing interest in methods for combining expert judgments and elicitation. I participated in a COST joint European award \"Expert Judgment Network: Bridging the Gap between Scientific Uncertainty and Evidence based decision making\" and with Simon French I led elicition of uncertainty handling after a nuclear accident for SAGE and COBR.\nI headed a successful bid as Co-Director of OxWaSP for an exciting new EPSRC funded initiative to train PhD students from Warwick and Oxford to use and develop new methodological and computational statistical techniques to help cope with the massive data sets and models now needing analysis in industry and society. I am also currently an active participant in Warwick University Bridges Programme supervising two students and two other students who are part of an CDT run by Complexity. \nTo check out some examples of my current academic work see my more recent publications given below.

New approaches to synthetic protein design offer the long-term potential for novel biotechnological and therapeutic applications. Statistical and computational methodology will be essential to realizing the promise of these technological developments.\nMy research has been funded by the U.K. Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (SABR and SYSMO initiatives), the U.K. Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, the European Union, the Leverhulme Trust, and the U.S. National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health.\n\nModelling gene regulatory networks \nOver 50 years ago the developmental biologist C.H. Waddington laid the conceptual foundations of modern systems biology in his book \"The Strategy of the Genes\", in which he envisaged an epigenetic landscape as the potential surface of a multidimensional state-space of cellular metabolism, underpinned by a network of interacting genes. With the advent of high-throughput post-genomic technologies, we are now beginning to investigate the topology of these networks. Increasingly, studies are being carried out that measure the expression profiles of large sets of genes, proteins or metabolites over a time course rather than a single static snapshot. This research aims to combine functional genomics and computation into a novel integrative systems approach, based on probabilistic modeling techniques, to identify key components of the regulatory networks involved in cell physiology. We aim to learn networks integrating transcriptional data with the production of proteins and metabolites with well-defined biological activity.\nMy group was the first to propose the use of state-space models (a simple class of probabilistic graphical model used for time series analysis) to the problem of inferring gene regulatory networks from high-throughput time series, such as microarray, proteomics and metabolomics data (Rangel et al., 2001). In the context of genetic regulatory networks, the hidden states of a state-space model can represent unmeasured factors, such as genes that have not been included in the microarray, levels of regulatory proteins, and the effects of mRNA and protein degradation. In collaboration with Lorantis Ltd., we have used state space models to reverse engineer transcriptional networks from highly replicated gene expression profiling time series data obtained from a well-established biological model of T cell activation. The resulting networks reflect many of the dynamics of an activated T cell and provide a methodology for the development of rational and experimentally testable hypotheses. In particular, they reveal the integrated activation of cytokines, proliferation, and adhesion following activation and place JunB and JunD at the center of the mechanisms that control apoptosis and proliferation (Rangel et al., 2004; Beal et al., 2005). More recently, in collaboration with scientists at Warwick School of Life Sciences, we are applying these methods to elucidate key transcriptional networks and underlying regulatory mechanisms controlling plant responses to pathogens, high light and drought. With the University of Birmingham, we also aim to develop a computational framework to reconstruct transcriptional and metabolic networks representative of the response of E. coli to acid stress.\nTo date most \u201ctop-down\u201d approaches to inferring dynamic networks from high-throughput time series data, including our own previous work as described above, have been based on the assumption that the topology of the network is homogeneous across time. However, most biological time series aim to capture information about processes which vary over time, and temporal changes in the transcription program are often apparent. There is little published work on inferring the structure of evolving biological networks with time-varying topologies. My current and future work focuses on developing flexible nonparametric Bayesian models, which will allow the discovery of the variables such as gene expression levels, protein concentrations, and experimental perturbations that cause structural changes in the network topology over time (Penfold et al., 2012).\nFast Bayesian computational methods for post-genomic data analysis\u2028\nA key feature that distinguishes the modern approach to Systems Biology is the aim of linking modeling of the interactions of system components with the huge volume and diversity of contemporary cellular and molecular data, such as that coming from high-throughput, genome-wide and imaging technologies. One of the most important challenges facing modern biology, medicine and agriculture is to understand how the genetic variation between individuals (the genotype) translates into the type of variation we can see or measure (the phenotype), and how environment influences this relationship. Although considerable progress has been made in recent years in identifying regulatory genes and modules in various organisms, there is still limited knowledge about downstream gene regulatory networks, and about how variation in these networks results in phenotypic differences, and is, in turn, affected by the environment.\nWe are currently developing new approaches to understanding the general principles that underlie the genotype-phenotype link through the integrated statistical modeling of post-genomic data from very disparate sources - for example, data from different experimental platforms, such as gene expression data with genomic or clinical indicators, integrated with proteomic or metabolomic measurements. Additional challenges posed by this problem include different sources of measurement noise, uncertain correspondence between measurements, varying patterns of missing data, and vastly different numbers of measurements for different experimental platforms. Our current work focuses on the development of nonparametric Bayesian models for the fusion of such heterogeneous data sources, based on inference in hierarchical graphical models. Although Bayesian methods provide a powerful framework for modeling, representing uncertainty, and combining prior knowledge with data, simple parametric models (for example, linear models) are often inadequate for modeling the complexity of real world biological processes. In the quest for creating more flexible modeling tools with a view to maintaining predictive reliability, recent research has turned to the limit of Bayesian models with infinitely many latent variables and parameters - these are also known as nonparametric Bayesian models. The term nonparametric is used because the model cannot be represented in terms of its parameters, since there would be an infinite number of them to learn and store, but instead is represented in terms of other quantities derived from the data that encapsulate the effect of these infinite number of parameters.\nThis type of modeling has already proven its utility in discovering transcriptional modules, identifying key protein complexes whose genes are co-regulated during the cell cycle, and revealing prognostic cancer subtypes, through the integration of gene expression data with transcription factor binding (ChIP-chip), protein-protein interaction and copy number variation data, respectively (Savage et al., 2010; Kirk et al, 2012; Yuan et al., 2011). In future work I intend to apply these approaches to the scientific goal of understanding the role that molecular phenotypes (such as gene expression levels or chromatin state) play in the overall genotype-phenotype map, and how environment influences this map.\nWe are also investigating methods for exploiting parallelism and scaling computation to very large data sets, particularly through general purpose Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) computation, an exciting modern direction in the high-performance computing community. Our initial results indicate that this approach holds the promise of reducing computational time by several orders of magnitude.\nAnalysing Protein Energetics with Stochastic Computation \nAlso over 50 years ago, the Nobel laureate Christian Anfinsen and colleagues demonstrated that protein molecules can fold into their three-dimensional \u2018native state\u2019 reversibly, leading to the view that these structures represented the global minimum of a rugged funnel-like \u2018energy landscape\u2019. Since this seminal work, computer simulations have continued to shed light on the phenomena of protein folding and function. However, protein modeling and structure prediction face two major challenges if progress is to be made in the development of more precise models, which quantitatively describe experimental observations. The first is the difficulty of efficient sampling in the enormous conformational space accessible to protein molecules, whilst the second is the development of the energy function describing molecular interactions for the problem at hand. The microscopic size of protein molecules makes it impossible to measure these interactions directly, and so known protein structures themselves have become the best available experimental evidence. Traditionally, empirical so-called \u2018knowledge-based statistical potentials\u2019 have been used to describe such interactions from analysis of a collection of known protein structures. This project aims to address both of these challenges. The overall goal of this research is to advance knowledge of protein energetics and improve on established modeling techniques that utilize these empirical knowledge-based potentials. We are using an approach, based on a novel statistical machine learning methodology known as \u2018Contrastive Divergence\u2019, to infer interaction potentials from a subset of known protein structures. We also utilize a novel Bayesian computational method for sampling the conformational space of molecular systems, known as \u2018Nested Sampling\u2019, which allows us to directly investigate the macroscopic states of the protein folding pathway and evaluate the associated absolute free energies without the need for thermodynamic integration (Burkoff et al., 2012).\nWhilst systems biology attempts to understand the design principles underpinning biological processes, synthetic biology attempts to apply this understanding to the design and construction of novel biological functions and systems not found in nature. One facet of synthetic biology is protein design, in which our increasing understanding of the principles underlying protein structure and function is being applied in the redesign of existing proteins, or the design of novel proteins. In future work I intend to explore the application of this toolkit of techniques to the \u2018inverse\u2019 problem of protein design.\nKey References \n1.
