Currently, my research also aims to apply the methods of statistical physics to problems related to static and dynamic Biological phenomena. \n\u00a0\nI would like to highlight the diversity of the methods I use to solve the problems I investigate, encompassing exact analytical methods (e.g., mean-field theory and RPA) and numerical methods (transfer matrix, exact enumeration, DMRG and CTMRG), often applied in innovative ways. This variety stems from the fact that my research is driven by physical problems rather than the application of any particular method.

No longer are computers necessarily unwieldy devices tied to their desk, tethered by power cords and network cabling. Nor are we anymore wedded to the mouse and keyboard for their user interface. The rise in ability and popularity of small mobile, wirelessly connected devices has changed for ever what we thought was possible.\nDespite these advances, distributed sensing is only feasible for a limited set of applications and inferring knowledge from these sensors is a problem that we do not yet hold the complete solution to.\nI want my research to form part of the solution \u2013 to enable inexpensive, reliable, long-lived wireless sensing that provide not just data, but meaningful and reliable high-level information\u201d.", "Personal profile\n                        \n\n\n\nBiographyI am an Associate Professor in Computer Science with a PhD in mathematics, working at Coventry University since April 2015.\nMy research expertise is on algorithms of symbolic computation (the automation of exact symbolic mathematics) and their implementation in computer algebra systems.
